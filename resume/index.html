            Profile
        </h2>
        <p>
            Loyally employed at the same company since 2007, but what I lack in varied experience I 
            compensate in loyalty. While working I have completed my bachelors degree, raised two children, and was home
            by the time they woke, effectively being a full-time at home parent, full-time student, and part-time employee.
            In summary, I am a committed hard worker, and if given the opportunity I will become an asset to any
            organization.

        <p>
            After successfully completing my education for Full-Stack 
            Web Development, I want to partner with a company that encourages me to
            grow creatively and professionally, working alongside like-minded individuals,
            for an organization with the betterment of all humankind in mind.
